## About This Project

This repository contains the complete source code for the official digital foundation (V1.0) of **Holos Cradle**, located at [holoscradle.com](https://www.holoscradle.com).

This initial site serves as the "Digital Front Door" for the movement, establishing our core identity and providing a central point of contact for our founding members and future clients.

## About Holos Cradle

**Holos Cradle** is the safe, foundational place where the journey to wholeness begins. Founded by Apostle Joseph Elisha Wako, The Integrationist, our mission is to provide the principles and tools for individuals, leaders, and organizations to achieve wholeness, transforming fragmentation into integrated strength.

We believe the silent epidemic of our time is fragmentationâ€”in our lives, our work, and our organizations. The solution is not more specialization, but deep, intentional **integration**.

## About the Founder

This project is the digital manifestation of the life's work of **Apostle Joseph Elisha Wako**, a spiritual leader, systems thinker, and the definitive authority on the principles of integration, known as **The Integrationist**.
