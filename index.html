                    <h3>What does 'Holos Cradle' mean?</h3>
                    <p>"Holos" is Greek for "whole." A "Cradle" is a safe place where new life begins. Together, Holos Cradle is the safe, foundational place where the journey to wholeness begins.</p>

                <div class="body-text">
                    <p>Our culture often misunderstands the multi-talented person. We are told to pick one lane, and so we end up feeling scattered—a collection of talents without a singular, powerful purpose. <strong>I know this because it was my story.</strong></p>
                    <p>This sense of fragmentation doesn't just affect us as individuals; it's the same hidden disease that causes organizations to fail—their work separated from their purpose, their skills from their spirit. They may achieve measures of success, but they are not <strong>whole</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I have made it my life's mission to solve this. As <strong>The Integrationist</strong>, I provide the principles and tools to help ambitious individuals forge their diverse skills into a unified strength, and to build organizations where every part works in perfect harmony.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the beginning of the journey.</p>
